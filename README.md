# 1. UX
## Project

A static frontend student project as part of Code Institute's milestone projects and a personal web development portfolio build with maximum effort and heart.

## User Goals

This portfolio is build to showcase current developer skills, experience level and quality of work to prospective employers and potential recruiters who look for web developer profiles that stand out. To present what employers seek for when looking at a programmer portfolio, this site focuses on the representation of **skills**, **educational background**, **current work** or **projects** and an introduction to a problem solving **personality**.

## Developer Goals

**Hands-on experience** to built a web development portfolio that looks and works flawlessly. **Implementation of features**, **run test** and gain **valuable experience** and problem-solving **practice**.

# 2. Features

## Planned Features
To give the user a good overview of the developer this portfolio should have a section showing the **educational history**, as well as a list of **technologies learned**. To get to know the developer as a person, an **about section** should be included as well as **social media links** and **contact information** for reachability and social proof.

## Features Implemented
- Technology skills
- Educational History section
- About section
- Social Media links
- Contact
- CV Download link

## Features Left to Implement
To further showcase the developers experience and body of work, a **portfolio section** of projects stating technologies used would deepen the understanding of the user. A personal **blog page** gives the developer a more personal and approachable note. Adding samples of coding work or short tutorials could be a way to contribute to the commnunity and shows the developers problem solving interest and invites other problem solving developers to discuss technology related topics.

## Design Choices
The design goal of this page is to deliver a clean and lean HTML and CSS project with a simple underlaying structure  and pure CSS effects to catch the eye for both mobile and desktop users. The navigation should be simple and intuitive yet fun to use to browse each section of the site.

## Wireframes

# 3. Technologies Used

This project is written in **HTML** and uses custom **CSS** for styling combined with **Bootstrap** elements. 
All of the custom code is partially written with **Visual Studio Code** on a personal **Mac** computer. This project uses **Git** for version control and is stored as a public repository at **GitHub**. 

# 4. Testing

**Google Chrome's Developer Tools** are used extensively for debugging as well as the built-in **Lighthouse** project to test the performance of this page. The responsive design has been tested using **Google Chrome's responsive feature** that emulates screen sizes of various mobile devices.

# 5. Deployment

The repository of this project is stored at **GitHub**. And the site is deployed as **GitHub page**. Please **click here** to visit the project site.
