## Project Introduction and Goal

As part of a student project of Code Institute, this page aims to deliver a static website written in pure HTML and CSS. 

### User Goals

This portfolio is build to showcase current developer skills, experience level and quality of work to prospective employers and potential recruiters who look for web developer profiles that stand out. To present what employers seek for when looking at a programmer portfolio, this site focuses on the representation of **skills**, **educational background**, **current work** or **projects** and an introduction to a problem solving **personality**.

### Developer Goals

**Hands-on experience** to built a web development portfolio that looks and works flawlessly. **Implementation of features**, **run test** and gain **valuable experience** and problem-solving **practice**.

## Features

### Planned Features

To give the user a good overview of the developer this portfolio should have a section showing the **educational history**, as well as a list of **technologies learned**. To get to know the developer as a person, an **about section** should be included as well as **social media links** and **contact information** for reachability and social proof.

### Features Implemented

- Technology skills
- Educational History section
- About section
- Social Media links
- Contact
- CV Download link

### Features Left to Implement

To further showcase the developers experience and body of work, a **portfolio section** of projects stating technologies used would deepen the understanding of the user. A personal **blog page** gives the developer a more personal and approachable note. Adding samples of coding work or short tutorials could be a way to contribute to the commnunity and shows the developers problem solving interest and invites other problem solving developers to discuss technology related topics.

## UX

### Design Choices and UX

The design goal of this page is to deliver a HTML and CSS only project with a simple underlaying structure and CSS effects to catch the eye for both mobile and desktop users. The navigation should be simple and intuitive yet fun to use to browse each section of the site. 

As this is my first page I develop myself I chose not to use Bootstrap and stay with pure HTML and CSS to understand the possibilties and limitations without external stylesheets implemented. 

The UX idea for this project is a full page slider where the content can be consumed instantly. Visitors can use gestures like swiping or flicks to navigate through the site on mobile, and through mouse clicks on a desktop computer. 

On the journey to fulfill the UX idea described above I had to realise that HTML and CSS alone actually does not recognize gestures without JavaScript. [HTML and CSS cannot figure out what the active slide is while JavaScript can set the active slide](https://css-tricks.com/can-get-pretty-far-making-slider-just-html-css/). Having this in mind I still hold on to the design decision to make pages as part of a slider and use buttons for navigation in both mobile and desktop view for this HTML/CSS only project.

### Wireframes

A simple full page slider to present content for instant consumption in desktop and mobile view.

A hidden menu that lives outside of the window and overlays the current window when clicking on the menu button.

### UX Features

Responsive menu with animated menu button in CSS.

Page transitions using CSS keyframes techniques.

## Technologies Used

This project is written in **HTML** and uses custom **CSS** for styling combined with **Bootstrap** elements. 
All of the custom code is partially written with the **Gitpod online editor** and **Visual Studio Code** on a personal **Mac** computer. This project uses **Git** for version control and is stored as a public repository at **GitHub**. 

## Testing

**Google Chrome's Developer Tools** are used extensively for debugging as well as the built-in **Lighthouse** project to test the performance of this page. The responsive design has been tested using **Google Chrome's responsive feature** that emulates screen sizes of various mobile devices.

## Deployment

The repository of this project is stored at **GitHub** and the site is deployed as **GitHub page**. Please [**click here**](https://theodor-at-github.github.io/ci-milestone-project-1/) to visit the project site.
